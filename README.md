# Spatio Temporal Clustering


**Description**

Traffic analysis and prediction from high amount of spatio-temporal data is an important problem for intelligent transportation systems. Discovering patterns in such large amount of data require novel approaches. Spatio-temporal clustering is a process of grouping objects based on their spatial and temporal similarity. 

This project focusses on the traffic data-set provided by Florida Department of Transport, known as ATSPM data. The approach tried is a density based approach and is known as ST-DBSCAN algorithm. We also make use of Nanocubes, a visualization platform especially built for visualizing data-sets consisting of millions of points. 


**Running**


For running visualizations on Nanocube, first install Nanocubes. Installation and related information available from - https://github.com/laurolins/nanocube


For a mini tutorial on creating a nanocube and launching on local server, refer to my youtube video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZqg8a4_bs&t=23s
